## Funding

MISP-LEA, a collaborative endeavor between Shadowserver and CIRCL, is a 24-month initiative funded by the European Union. The project’s central aim is to establish operational and enduring MISP and AIL instances dedicated specifically to law enforcement agencies. This setup will facilitate a smoother exchange of evidence between law enforcement agencies and improve the onset of collaborative investigations. For this purpose, the system will ingest data from Shadowserver’s ransomware and C2 infrastructure tracking.

Law enforcement agencies willing to discover and leverage the MISP-LEA platform can apply on the [misp-lea.org](https://misp-lea.org/) website.
