title:  "AIL v6.3 – Passive SSH Integration for Onion Correlation and Deanonymization"
author: AIL Project Team 
---

We’re excited to release **AIL Framework v6.3** which includes [Passive SSH](https://github.com/D4-project/passive-ssh) integration, enabling correlation of SSH keys across onion services, IPs, and domains. This helps identify shared infrastructure and supports onion deanonymization efforts. Multiple bugs were fixed and many improvements were included.

## Key Feature: Passive SSH Integration for Onion Correlation

AIL now integrates with **Passive SSH**, allowing:

- **SSH key correlation** across IPs, domains, and onion services.
- A new **SSH key object** with sidebar display and linking.
- **Passive SSH search and lookup** within AIL.
- New IP object to correlate **IPs** and **SSH keys**.

This enables deanonymization of onion services through infrastructure fingerprinting based on shared SSH keys.

## Notable Changes

### Onion Module
- Reduced redundant duplicate checks.
- Only print task UUID when a new task is created.
- Fixed exceptions for invalid URLs and `None` domains.

### QR Code Extraction
- Added support for **color-inverted QR codes**.

### IP & Domain Handling
- New IP object with SSH key correlation.
- Print deanonymized hostnames.
- Replaced and removed FAUP with `psl_faup`.
- Improved domain parsing (including missing schemes).

### Image Engine
- Added domain description functionality.
- Improved progress logging and display.

### Language Handling
- Avoid sending unsupported languages to LibreTranslate.
- Added support for `be` (Belarusian).
- Improved language selection and translation handling in UI.

### Tracker & Stats
- Added heatmap: matches by year.
- Option to avoid duplicate notifications.
- New function to get AIL-wide stats.

### ZMQImporter
- Content filtering by `feeder_name` and pattern.
- Improved debug messages and output.

### API
- Added endpoint: get onions grouped by month.

## Fixes

- Removed all uses of FAUP and migrated to python `psl_faup`.
- Fixed:
  - Domain extraction and parsing bugs.
  - IP-to-SSH key correlation.
  - Sidebar rendering for IPs and SSH keys.
  - Retro hunt filters and metadata cleanup.
  - CE Detector retagging behavior.
  - Various UI issues (icons, sparkline removal, template bugs).
  - Updater version tagging and leftover debug output.

## Funding

MISP-LEA, a collaborative endeavor between Shadowserver and CIRCL, is a 24-month initiative funded by the European Union. The project’s central aim is to establish operational and enduring MISP and AIL instances dedicated specifically to law enforcement agencies. This setup will facilitate a smoother exchange of evidence between law enforcement agencies and improve the onset of collaborative investigations. For this purpose, the system will ingest data from Shadowserver’s ransomware and C2 infrastructure tracking.

Law enforcement agencies willing to discover and leverage the MISP-LEA platform can apply on the [misp-lea.org](https://misp-lea.org/) website.
