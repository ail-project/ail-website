## What's New in AIL 6.2

    *   **Welcome Emails for New Users:** New users can now automatically receive a welcome email upon account creation.
    *   **New User Configuration Engine:** Users can now create and save MISP accounts and API keys directly within AIL, enabling seamless data export to MISP instances or generation of MISP JSON files.
*   **Richer Correlation Capabilities:** Discover new connections with added correlations for chat-to-CVE, chat-to-cryptocurrencies, and domain-to-chat/message.
*   **New Mail Object:** A new mail object has been introduced, improving search and correlations with chats, domains, and crawled data.
*   **Module Statistics:** The settings module now includes statistics for your AIL modules.
*   **Language Statistics in Chat Viewer:** Gain insights into language distribution within chats directly in the chat viewer.

## Funding

MISP-LEA, a collaborative endeavor between Shadowserver and CIRCL, is a 24-month initiative funded by the European Union. The project’s central aim is to establish operational and enduring MISP and AIL instances dedicated specifically to law enforcement agencies. This setup will facilitate a smoother exchange of evidence between law enforcement agencies and improve the onset of collaborative investigations. For this purpose, the system will ingest data from Shadowserver’s ransomware and C2 infrastructure tracking.

Law enforcement agencies willing to discover and leverage the MISP-LEA platform can apply on the [misp-lea.org](https://misp-lea.org/) website.
