title:  "AIL v6.6 – Advanced PDF Processing and Manual Crawling Support"
author: AIL Project Team 
---

AIL v6.6 is a release with a strong focus on **PDF ingestion and translation**, **crawler improvements**, and **operational enhancements across users, queues, and metadata handling**. 

This version significantly expands AIL’s document-processing and data-collection capabilities by introducing a hardened PDF ingestion pipeline where **all PDFs are converted to PDF/A and stripped of embedded metadata before ingestion to remove malicious content**. 

It also allows users to **browse content locally with [Lacus](https://github.com/ail-project/lacus) and send captured pages directly to AIL as crawler data**, along with associated **browser cookies and local storage imported as a cookiejar** for reuse by the crawler, while continuing to improve reliability, scalability, and analyst workflows.

## New PDF Parsing Capabilities 

The example below is an automatic conversion of PDF document processed in AIL from a chat channel where the translation is done automatically and displayed as an overlay on the original text.

The PDF metadata are also now considered as new pivot data points (e.g. author name) in AIL to allow correlation among those selectors.
