- **Database Upgrade**: The database has been migrated from ARDB to [Kvrocks](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kvrocks).
- **New Correlation Engine**: AIL v5.0 introduces a new powerful correlation engine with two new correlation types: CVE and Title.
- **Enhanced Logging**: The logging system has been improved to provide better troubleshooting capabilities.
- **Tagging Support**: [AIL objects](https://github.com/ail-project/ail-framework/blob/master/doc/README.md#ail-objects) now support tagging, allowing users to categorize and label extracted information for easier analysis and organization.
- **Trackers**: Improved objects filtering, PGP and decoded tracking added.
- **UI Leak Visualization**: The user interface has been upgraded to visualize extracted and tracked information.
- **New Crawler [Lacus](https://github.com/ail-project/lacus)**: improve crawling capabilities.
- **Modular [Importers](https://github.com/ail-project/ail-framework/blob/master/doc/README.md#ail-importers) and Exporters**: New [importers](https://github.com/ail-project/ail-framework/blob/master/doc/README.md#ail-importers) (ZMQ, AIL Feeders) and exporters (MISP, Mail, TheHive) modular design.
Allow easy creation and customization by extending an abstract class.
- **Module Queues**: improved the queuing mechanism between detection modules.

# JTAN

Development of the AIL framework is co-funded by the European Union CEF program and [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/).

The Action will establish a Joint Threat Analysis Network, an open collaboration group of European computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) with the focus on collecting, sharing and analysis of technical, operational and strategic threat intelligence. The purpose of this collaboration is to combine unique advantages of different teams to obtain comprehensive situational awareness and actionable information to effectively defend constituencies in each Member State, from critical infrastructure operators targeted by state-sponsored actors to individual citizens affected by cybercrime. The main part of the Action addresses gaps in the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tooling that is currently used by the national level CSIRTs in Europe. By strengthening individual tools and interconnecting them, the beneficiaries will achieve a new level of common situational awareness and they will benefit from shared knowledge and tooling.
