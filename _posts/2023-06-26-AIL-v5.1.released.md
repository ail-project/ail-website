Version 5.1 (2023-06-26) includes several changes, fixes, and updates. The changes include fixing gzipped pastes in the pystemon importer, showing a message when the maximum number of nodes is reached in the correlation graph, and adding the ability to auto tag crawled domains. Additionally, new features were added such as pagination for title searches, the ability to search title IDs and contents, and the inclusion of a favicon object.

Several fixes were implemented, including resolving issues with base64 encoding in the pystemon importer, maintaining the same capture UUID for already crawled domains in the crawler, and handling empty queues in the IPAdress module. Other fixes addressed issues with title searches returning empty results, incomplete responses in the crawler, and errors related to user tokens and deletion.

Various improvements were made to different modules and objects, such as the addition of a new `cookie-name` object along with its correlation, enhancements to importers, improvements to the HOWTO guide, and updates to correlation graphs and statistics. The Phone module was also updated to filter invalid phone numbers and display extracted information in the user interface.

In addition to the changes and fixes, there were updates to the MISP export, domains explorer, daterange object, tracker module, and various other components. The README.md file and CI badge were corrected, the installer was fixed for YARA and pycld3 installations, and tests were updated and replaced.

Lastly, there were some general updates, including merging changes from the old CIRCL/AIL-framework repository (the official repository is [ail-project/ail-framework](https://github.com/ail-project/ail-framework) and incorporating a pull request related to email categorization.

Overall, version 5.1 introduced new features, addressed several issues, and included various updates and improvements to different parts of the system.

# JTAN

Development of the AIL framework is co-funded by the European Union CEF program and [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/).

The Action will establish a Joint Threat Analysis Network, an open collaboration group of European computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) with the focus on collecting, sharing and analysis of technical, operational and strategic threat intelligence. The purpose of this collaboration is to combine unique advantages of different teams to obtain comprehensive situational awareness and actionable information to effectively defend constituencies in each Member State, from critical infrastructure operators targeted by state-sponsored actors to individual citizens affected by cybercrime. The main part of the Action addresses gaps in the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tooling that is currently used by the national level CSIRTs in Europe. By strengthening individual tools and interconnecting them, the beneficiaries will achieve a new level of common situational awareness and they will benefit from shared knowledge and tooling.
