The latest release, version 5.2 of the AIL project framework, introduces several changes, fixes, and improvements. Some notable changes include the removal of old updates prior to version 5.0, a refactoring of the background updater along with the addition of the v5.2 update, and the introduction of a new etag object. The correlation graph now offers an option to hide objects/nodes and reset functionality using the "H" key. Additionally, an object comment feature has been added to investigations.

Several fixes have been implemented in this release. The environment issues in the updater and background update modules have been resolved. The crawler now includes timeouts for Unknown captures and exception handling for ping_lacus. It also performs an existence check for screenshot sets. The decoding process for downloaded files has been fixed, and the tag functionality for correlation objects has been improved. Fixes have also been made to the updater module, including the removal of old ARDB environment references. Lastly, issues with MISP event JSON export and retro hunt date search and description in the hunter module have been addressed.

In terms of contributors, [Thirion Aurélien](https://github.com/terrtia) and [fukusuket](https://github.com/fukusuket) have made significant contributions to this release, addressing specific issues and providing fixes.

# JTAN

Development of the AIL framework is co-funded by the European Union CEF program and [CIRCL](https://www.circl.lu/).

The Action will establish a Joint Threat Analysis Network, an open collaboration group of European computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs) with the focus on collecting, sharing and analysis of technical, operational and strategic threat intelligence. The purpose of this collaboration is to combine unique advantages of different teams to obtain comprehensive situational awareness and actionable information to effectively defend constituencies in each Member State, from critical infrastructure operators targeted by state-sponsored actors to individual citizens affected by cybercrime. The main part of the Action addresses gaps in the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) tooling that is currently used by the national level CSIRTs in Europe. By strengthening individual tools and interconnecting them, the beneficiaries will achieve a new level of common situational awareness and they will benefit from shared knowledge and tooling.
