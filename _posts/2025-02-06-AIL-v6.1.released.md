We are excited to announce the release of **AIL Project v6.1**, bringing significant improvements, new features, and important bug fixes. This update enhances the crawler's control mechanisms, improves file and chat processing capabilities, and refines various UI elements to provide a more efficient user experience.

AIL introduced a pre-filtering mechanism to limit the risk of potential crawling of unsafe content. This feature is now enabled by default, allowing administrators to decide whether to enable or disable it according to their specific needs.

## Funding

MISP-LEA, a collaborative endeavor between Shadowserver and CIRCL, is a 24-month initiative funded by the European Union. The project‚Äôs central aim is to establish operational and enduring MISP and AIL instances dedicated specifically to law enforcement agencies. This setup will facilitate a smoother exchange of evidence between law enforcement agencies and improve the onset of collaborative investigations. For this purpose, the system will ingest data from Shadowserver‚Äôs ransomware and C2 infrastructure tracking.

Law enforcement agencies willing to discover and leverage the MISP-LEA platform can apply on the [misp-lea.org](https://misp-lea.org/) website.
