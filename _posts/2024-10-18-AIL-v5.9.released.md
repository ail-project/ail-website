# AIL Project Release v5.9 - 2024-10-18

We are glad to announce the release of AIL v5.9, packed with numerous updates and fixes that enhance the performance and features of the framework. This release focuses on improvements in qrcode handling, `dom-hash` support, title processing, and crawler operations, among other critical updates.

`dom-hash` is a structural fingerprint of the HTML’s Document Object Model (DOM) originally developed by CERT.PL.

The fingerprint is calculated by extracting all the tag names (ignoring the content itself as well as attributes of the HTML Page). The tag names are concatenated with a pipe value |, hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm, and truncated to the first 32 characters.

Software such as [LookyLoo](https://lookyloo.circl.lu/) or [MISP](https://www.misp-project.org/) have implemented the algorithm, the AIL framework now support the `dom-hash` algorithm to cluster and group similar page structure.

## Funding

MISP-LEA, a collaborative endeavor between Shadowserver and CIRCL, is a 24-month initiative funded by the European Union. The project’s central aim is to establish operational and enduring MISP and AIL instances dedicated specifically to law enforcement agencies. This setup will facilitate a smoother exchange of evidence between law enforcement agencies and improve the onset of collaborative investigations. For this purpose, the system will ingest data from Shadowserver’s ransomware and C2 infrastructure tracking.

Law enforcement agencies willing to discover and leverage the MISP-LEA platform can apply on the [misp-lea.org](https://misp-lea.org/) website.
